E-Cubes educational framework implementation - containerized cybersecurity and digital forensics learning modules with hands-on assignments, video demonstrations, and practical tools for network security and forensics training.

Project Overview
There is a need for easy-to-install, easy-to-use, and easy-to-support educational materials that can be distributed to different individuals and communities lacking access to proper cyber resources and the support of dedicated IT staff. Addressing this need, we introduce E-Cubes, a customizable, extensible, and convenient educational framework, which is deployed as open-access, plug-and-play, and hands-on learning modules, supporting different educational experiences including class assignments, guided laboratory exercises, competition challenges, and others.

E-Cubes is available via the Open Source via CC BY (Creative Commons) licensing option as a series of self-contained modules featuring four layers:

(i) The Container layer: Provides enhanced convenience for installing E-Cubes in user-specific hardware and software platforms leveraging OS-level virtualization.

(ii) The Tools layer: Provides the necessary back-end software platforms supporting the educational tasks. Examples include OS, Software Development Kits (SDKs), Runtime Libraries, and Security/AI suites. This way, all necessary tools are installed on a specific container and ready to use, thus preventing configuration issues and troubles.

(iii) The Payload layer: Contains the educational materials for the learning experience. Examples include exercises, course assignments, lab sessions, and competition challenges.

(iv) The Support layer: Contains additional materials to assist the students on completing the educational payload described before. Examples include tutorials, videos, and documentation websites.

E-Cubes makes use of the Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction (ARCS) model as the foundational theoretical background:

(i) Attention: E-Cubes strives to attract the learner’s interest by focusing on topics that are relevant to them and developing strategies to keep them engaged.

(ii) Relevance: E-Cubes is intended to include contents that are relevant in the real world, and are deemed as useful by learners, such as mapping theoretical topics with recent news regarding security incidents and data leaks.

(iii) Confidence: E-Cubes is developed as a step-by-step process focused on generating confidence from learners on the topics being addressed so they can feel satisfied with their progress.

(iv) Satisfaction: Future versions of E-Cubes will also include instruments to measure the learner’s satisfaction with the educational materials and activities.

Two prototypes of E-Cubes are currently available: one featuring lab exercises for an undergraduate-level Network Security class, and another one featuring a graduate-level Digital Forensics class.
